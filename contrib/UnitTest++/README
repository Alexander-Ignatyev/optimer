Fork UnitTest++ by Alexander Ignatyev (ignatyev.alexander at gmail.com).
See original README below the line.

Version 1.5 (2013-06-07):
- TeamCity support.
- Micrated to cmake (cmake.org).
- Fixed a minor bug.
- Mute an unsupported test "CrashingTestsAreReportedAsFailures" in Visual Studio.

See src/tests/Main.cpp how to execute on TeamCity.

Build instruction for UNIX (OS X, Linux):
# cd <path-to-UnitTest++>
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..
# make && make test

Build instruction for Windows:
# cd <path-to-UnitTest++>
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..
now open generated Visual Studio solution file in build directory.

Release notes:
--------------
Version 1.4 (2008-10-30)
- CHECK macros work at arbitrary stack depth from inside TESTs.
- Remove obsolete TEST_UTILITY macros
- Predicated test execution (via TestRunner::RunTestsIf)
- Better exception handling for fixture ctors/dtors.
- VC6/7/8/9 support

Version 1.3 (2007-4-22)
- Removed dynamic memory allocations (other than streams)
- MinGW support
- Consistent (native) line endings
- Minor bug fixing

Version 1.2 (2006-10-29)
- First pass at documentation.
- More detailed error crash catching in fixtures.
- Standard streams used for printing objects under check. This should allow the

  stream operators to ostream.
- Standard streams can be optionally compiled off by defining UNITTEST_USE_CUSTOM_STREAMS
  in Config.h
- Added named test suites
- Added CHECK_ARRAY2D_CLOSE 
- Posix library name is libUnitTest++.a now
- Floating point numbers are postfixed with f in the failure reports

Version 1.1 (2006-04-18)
- CHECK macros do not have side effects even if one of the parameters changes state
- Removed CHECK_ARRAY_EQUAL (too similar to CHECK_ARRAY_CLOSE)
- Added local and global time constraints
- Removed dependencies on strstream
- Improved Posix signal to exception translator
- Failing tests are added to Visual Studio's error list
- Fixed Visual Studio projects to work with spaces in directories
